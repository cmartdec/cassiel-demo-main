# cassiel-demo
 This is a game dev personal project called Cassiel. It was on Steam for a period of time and it collected more than 100 wishlists. I have the opportunity to learn shaders, oop and gdscirpt which is quite similar to python!

 All the pixel art, game design and programming was made by me. You can check out the game here! - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy72y3OfeLA
